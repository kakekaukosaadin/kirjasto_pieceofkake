# kirjasto_pieceofkake

Project made during my military service for HÃ¤meenlinnan Sotilaskotiyhdistys which allows conscripts to reserve
books etc. from the library and staff to keep track of who has borrowed what.

The project is not in use nowadays but can be accessed at <https://kirjasto.pieceofkake.fi>
